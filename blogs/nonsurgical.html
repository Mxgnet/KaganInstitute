                                        <p>Let’s face it – some of us aren’t in love with the shape of our noses. While
                                            your nose may have been cute as a button when you were younger, it’s
                                            sometimes the case that getting older changes the shape of your nose in a
                                            way that you might not like. The experts at Kagan Institute in Los Angeles,
                                            CA know that a non-surgical nose job with dermal fillers like Juvederm and
                                            Radiesse can reshape your nose and improve your aesthetics.</p>

                                <p>Most people who want to improve the shape of their noses are good candidates for this
                                    treatment. The key thing to remember about this treatment is that it will only alter
                                    the shape of the nose, not the size of the nose or any significant internal
                                    structures, such as a deviated septum. In other words, if your goal is to improve
                                    the superficial aesthetics of your nose, then this treatment may be ideal for you.
                                    Some qualifying factors include.</p>
                            </div>

                            <div class="blog-text">
                                <p>One of the more important qualifying factors for this treatment includes patients who
                                    prefer to not have traditional nose job surgery. Rhinoplasty can greatly alter the
                                    size and shape of your nose, but the recovery from this procedure is often long and
                                    painful. If you want to reshape your nose without surgery, then this treatment is
                                    right for you.</p>

                                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">The way a non-surgical nose job works is by injecting
                                    dermal fillers into areas of the nose to essentially cover up areas of concern, such
                                    as bumps, humps, or other aesthetic issues. Dermal fillers increase the volume of
                                    the skin, so it’s very easy to use a dermal filler to smooth areas of the nose to
                                    correct the overall shape of your nose, nose tip, or even nostrils.</p>

                                <p>A non-surgical nose job is less risky than a traditional nose job surgery, but you
                                    will still want to be aware of certain allergies related to dermal fillers. During
                                    your consultation, you will need to verify that you have no known allergies to the
                                    ingredients in the dermal fillers used for your treatment. Fortunately, both
                                    Juvederm and Radiesse are considered non-allergenic treatments, so the vast majority
                                    of people will not need to be concerned about any allergic reactions.</p>

                                <p>It’s important to have realistic goals for this treatment. Only certain issues can be

                                    have a hump, bump, drooping nose tip, or nose asymmetry. This treatment works as
                                    camouflage for minor to moderate superficial concerns and will not correct issues
                                    related to size or functional problems inside the nose.</p>

                                    most normal daily activities. The only restrictions you will have will be to avoid

                                    at least 24 to 48 hours. We may give you specific post-treatment instructions to

                                <p>Finally, people who seek non-surgical nose jobs want to have fast results. While the
                                    results of a traditional nose job can take several weeks or months to fully heal,
                                    the results after this treatment can be seen in a matter of days. In fact, you will
                                    likely see immediate results on the same day as your treatment. As the dermal filler
                                    settles, your results will improve within one to two weeks.</p>

                                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">The results of your non-surgical nose job will last for
                                    about six to 12 months based on the durability of the dermal filler. Some people may
                                    be able to enjoy results that last longer than 12 months based on factors such as
                                    age, metabolism, and your specific biological response to the dermal filler formula.
                                    It’s possible that your touch-ups for this treatment will be scheduled once a year
                                    or once every six months depending on the longevity of your results.</p>

                                <p>Absolutely! In fact, it’s common to use a few non-surgical treatments at the same
                                    time to improve your overall aesthetics. By having all of your treatments at one
                                    time, it’s much easier to keep up with your treatment touch-ups. non-surgical
                                    treatments with dermal fillers can contour essentially every area of the face,
                                    including the lips, cheek, chin, and jawline. It’s very common to use a dermal
                                    filler in multiple areas of the face to achieve your aesthetic goals.</p>

                                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">Other treatments you can use include neurotoxins such as
                                    Botox. Using a neurotoxin treatment can relax the appearance of deep or dynamic
                                    wrinkles, particularly on the forehead, around the eyes, and around the mouth. Botox
                                    and dermal filler treatments are commonly combined to correct complex aesthetic

                                    examine your nose, and determine if this treatment is appropriate for your aesthetic

                                    also take a photograph of your nose to help map out where to use the dermal filler

                                    appointment may last longer. Overall, most patients consider this a “lunchtime”

                                    non-surgical nose job. Most dermal fillers are approved for people who are over the
                                    age of 21. Because a dermal filler works to increase collagen production to correct
                                    skin volume, this treatment can easily be used for older people.</p>

                                <p>You can have this treatment at any time, even if you are scheduled only a few weeks
                                    before a special occasion. Because there is no lengthy recovery time and the results
                                    of this treatment are essentially immediate, it’s easy to schedule this treatment
                                    during a convenient time for you. That said, if you can, it’s always a good idea to
                                    schedule dermal filler appointments at least one month before a special occasion.

                                <p>Aside from less pain, a faster recovery time, and faster results, is there another
                                    reason to consider this non-surgical treatment? Many people like to use this
                                    treatment as a stepping stone before a traditional rhinoplasty. This treatment
                                    allows them to have a preview of the results they might achieve with a traditional
                                    nose job. Because the results of this treatment are temporary, you can use this
                                    treatment to tweak your desired results and test out what you will look like after
                                    surgical rhinoplasty.</p>

                                <p>Minor aesthetic concerns, such as a bump on the bridge of the nose, can make some

                                    aging, crookedness from a previous injury, or bumps in the structure of your nose
                                    are all minor concerns that can be easily corrected with a non-surgical nose
