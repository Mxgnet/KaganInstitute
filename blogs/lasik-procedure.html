                                <p>LASIK is a procedure that is used to correct a wide range of vision issues.
                                    Scientists have been using this technique, which is also known as Laser-Assisted In
                                    Situ Keratomileusis, to enhance eyesight for more than two decades. There is no

                                    your eyesight. As result, you will need to be older than 21 when you receive this
                                    eye procedure.</p>

                                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">Further, you should not have experienced a significant

                                    months. To ensure that you meet this requirement, you should bring in your old
                                    prescriptions or glasses to your initial appointment.

                                    thoroughly examine your eyes. During this meeting, you should also be prepared to

                                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">You should also let us know if any eye issues run in your

                                    or other health conditions that affected their vision or corneas. This information
                                    will help us determine whether you should use this technique to improve your

                                    blurry.

                                    people who are far away will look blurry to you. For example, you might be unable to

                                    During these visits, your healthcare provider will examine your eyes and talk about

                                <p>Under some circumstances, we may use this powerful technique to improve the vision in
                                    one of your eyes. For example, you may have vision issues that affect only one eye.
                                    In particular, one of your eyes may have normal vision, while your other eye cannot
                                    see faraway objects.
                                </p>
                                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">The best way to determine whether you will need to improve
                                    both of your eyes is to schedule a consultation with us. After we have examined your
                                    eyes and reviewed your glasses and contact prescription, we will tell you if you
                                    should use LASIK to improve one or both of your eyes.</p>

                                <p>If you are over 45 and have good distance vision but need to wear glasses when you
                                    are using a computer, making calls on your smartphone, and reading books, you might
                                    be a good candidate for a vision procedure called NearVision CK. After your
                                    appointment is complete, your vision may improve for about three to seven years. To
                                    achieve longer changes in your eyesight, you can receive follow-up procedures.
                                </p>
                                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">In general, you will be able to receive four to five
                                    additional procedures during your lifetime. Since we will use topical anesthetic
                                    drops to numb your eyes, you will be able to relax during each of your appointments.
                                    In general, it will only take us ten minutes to improve the vision in both eyes.
                                    After this process is complete, it will usually take up to two days for your eyes to
                                    recover.

                                <p>If you have mild to moderate farsightedness, astigmatism, or nearsightedness, you
                                    should think about getting a photorefractive keratectomy. This procedure is also
                                    called PRK. During your appointment, we will use laser energy to improve the shape
                                    of your corneas. This technique will enhance the focus of the light that moves
                                    through your retinas.

                                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">You will usually see the final impact of this corrective
                                    procedure within one to three months. After you have recovered, you may be able to
                                    stop using glasses or contacts to correct your vision. Since we will use a unique
                                    technique to enhance your eyesight, you might be a good candidate if you do not
                                    qualify for other corrective laser procedures. For example, you might be able to use
                                    this technique if you have thin corneal tissues.

                                    shape of your eyes, we will use a special lens to improve your vision. Since we will
                                    usually fix one eye during each session, you will need to attend multiple
                                    appointments.

                                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">Your eyes will quickly recover, and you may experience
                                    dramatic changes in your vision after one day has passed. To help you remain
                                    comfortable during this procedure, we will give you local or topical anesthesia.
                                    Under some circumstances, we may also instruct you to take a mild sedative. After we
                                    have finished improving your eyes, you may need to use oral medication or eye drops
                                    for a while. You’ll also need to attend a follow-up appointment.
