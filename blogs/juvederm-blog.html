                                        <p>As you get older, you’ve likely noticed your skin changing. Its overall
                                            texture and appearance begin to transform with age, and you’ve probably
                                            noticed wrinkling, sagging, and folding on your face. If you’re looking for
                                            a safe, effective, and fast-acting solution, then getting Juvederm
                                            treatments at Kagan Institute in Los Angeles or Encino, LA could be the

                                    lost with age, then Juvederm could be the right solution for you. This is a super

                                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">It’s normal for your skin to change as you get older. But
                                    many of these changes can
                                    cause a lot of self-consciousness and discomfort. You may not appreciate the
                                    wrinkles and sagging that have begun to appear. If you decide to go with this
                                    injectable, you’ll get almost immediate results, allowing you to feel your best.

                                    into it very deeply. Before you book your appointment to receive this filler, you’d
                                    probably like to know what exactly it is. Here’s an in-depth look at what this
                                    filler does, and how it can help you look younger and healthier.

                            </div>

                            <div class="blog-text">
                                <p>Before we talk about what this filler can do for you, you need to understand the way
                                    your skin works. Your skin is made up of many different chemicals, including
                                    proteins called elastin and collagen. These proteins serve several purposes,
                                    including providing your skin with its structure and allowing it to stay elastic.
                                    This elasticity is what makes it smooth back out after you’ve made facial
                                    expressions and relaxed the muscles.
                                </p>

                                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">However, as you get older, the chemical makeup of your skin
                                    begins to change. The amounts of collagen and elastin begin to reduce, and the
                                    creases that form when you make facial expressions start to become permanent
                                    wrinkles and folds. Gravity also begins to take a firmer hold, which causes sagging
                                    to happen.
                                </p>

                                <p>This is a hyaluronic acid-based filler. Hyaluronic acid is a sugar that is naturally
                                    found in various parts of the body. This includes your skin, your connective
                                    tissues, and your eyes.

                                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">This filler is an injectable, which means that a very fine
                                    and precise needle is used to apply the product to different areas. It is also
                                    applied at different depths underneath your skin to help you achieve the results you
                                    want. There are several different types of this filler, and different ones will be
                                    applied to different parts of the face to help you achieve the best results.
                                </p>

                                <p>This particular type is designed specifically to provide volume to the cheek area. As
                                    your skin begins to lose collagen and elastin, your cheeks are one of the first
                                    areas to be affected. You’ll lose a significant amount of volume which makes you
                                    look older. The skin will also sag more.
                                </p>
                                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">Voluma XC will help put back the volume you may have lost.
                                    This makes your face look fuller, younger and smooths out sagging and wrinkles in
                                    the area.
                                </p>

                                <p>Because facial movements will cause and exacerbate wrinkles, the area around your
                                    nose and mouth tends to be very prone to getting wrinkled. This is because the areas
                                    move around so much.
                                </p>
                                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">Combine this with a loss of volume in the area, and it’s
                                    easy to see why the skin gets so wrinkled. XC and Vollure XC help to fill in smile
                                    lines, or wrinkles that have appeared around the nose and mouth.

                                    and serious.

                                <p>When it’s injected into your skin, the hyaluronic acid inside this filler will
                                    accomplish several goals. As soon as it’s injected, the product will provide
                                    fullness to the areas where it’s applied. The hyaluronic acid in it will then begin
                                    to work, stimulating your body’s collagen production. Over time, the hyaluronic acid
                                    is safely absorbed by your body, leaving just the collagen behind.
                                </p>
                                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">Hyaluronic acid also serves another purpose. One of the
                                    things it’s known for is its ability to retain moisture. Keeping skin hydrated is an
                                    important part of keeping it young and healthy-looking. By attracting moisture,
                                    you’ll find that you’re able to enjoy your results from these injections for a
                                    longer time.

                                    treatment is done, they will be subtle, helping you to avoid those uncomfortable

                                    synthetic ingredients or ingredients that you may not feel comfortable injecting
                                    into the skin especially if you’re particularly sensitive.

                                    in your body, and stimulating the production of a protein that your skin is made up
                                    of naturally.

                                <p>There are many treatment options available if you’re looking to get a more youthful
                                    appearance, including surgical ones. However, surgical options have many downsides.
                                    First, they take up a lot of time. Not only do you need to think about the surgery
                                    itself, which will take hours, but you also need to think about weeks-long recovery
                                    time.
                                </p>
                                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">Surgery also comes with a lot of health risks because it’s
                                    so invasive. If you want to get effective results without the risk, then this filler
                                    is perfect for you. With just a few quick and easy injections, you’ll get the
                                    results you’re looking for, and then you can be on your way.</p>

                                <p>Many anti-wrinkle treatment options require a lot of preparation beforehand. But if

                                    easy. There are just a few things you’ll need to avoid to keep the treatment as
                                    effective as possible and prevent your skin from bruising. We’ll be able to give you
                                    a full list of what you should avoid.

                                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">Some of these things include aspirin and ibuprofen. There
                                    are a few supplements you’ll need to stop from taking, too. If you drink or smoke
                                    often, then make sure to avoid these activities for at least 24 hours before it’s
                                    time for your appointment.

                                <p>Every treatment will begin with a consultation. This gives us a chance to discuss
                                    what results you’re looking for from the treatment and allows you to ask any
                                    questions you may have about the process. During this time we’ll be able to set
                                    expectations and determine what areas are of concern to you.

                                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">Once the consultation is over, we can set you up with your
                                    appointment. At your appointment, we’ll start by carefully cleaning the areas where
                                    the product will be applied, removing any grime, oil, or sweat that’s built up.
                                    Then, our technicians will use a very fine needle to strategically apply the product
                                    in the desired areas, giving you the healthy, natural-looking results you want.

                                    extremely quick, and you’ll just need to take care to stay clear of a few things.

                                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">Try not to spend time in direct sunlight or perform any
                                    strenuous activity for the next day or so after treatment. You should also not apply
                                    any makeup or consume alcohol for the next 24 hours. Otherwise, you’ll be able to
                                    get back to work immediately after treatment.
