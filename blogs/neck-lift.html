                                            youthful, firm necks. Sagging, lax skin can weigh down our necks, making us
                                            look older or heavier than we are. The good news is that a neck lift can
                                            give you the supple, youthful beauty you’re looking for. Dr. Kagan at the

                            </div>
                            <div class="blog-text">
                                <p>In general, you can expect your neck lift to last between 10 and 15 years, depending
                                    on how severely your skin was sagging when you underwent the procedure. Other
                                    factors that can affect the longevity of your results include your age at the time
                                    you have the procedure and how quickly your body ages. Everyone’s body is different,
                                    and the single biggest factor is how quickly your personal collagen levels are
                                    decreasing. Collagen is the protein that gives our skin strength and keeps it supple
                                    and pliable.
                                </p>

                                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">As a rule of thumb, collagen production starts slowing in
                                    our 20s and really ramps down at around age 30. Again, each person is different, and
                                    lifestyle choices can also make a difference here. A healthy diet, plenty of
                                    hydration, and regular exercise are good for collagen production. Excessive alcohol
                                    intake, any tobacco use, a diet high in refined sugars and starches, and
                                    over-exposure to the sun all interfere with collagen production. When you come to
                                    talk with Dr. Kagen, we can help you get a better sense of how long a neck lift will
                                    last for you, personally.

                                    fats, and a colorful variety of fruits and vegetables. Be sure to exercise
                                    regularly, striking a balance between aerobic exercise and weight training. Avoid
                                    tobacco entirely and minimize your alcohol intake. All these habits are good for
                                    your body generally and help your genes resist the aging process, as well as they,
                                    possibly can.
                                </p>
                                <p style="margin: 18px 0 0 0;">Drinking plenty of water is important because hydrated
                                    cells
                                    are better able to
                                    retain collagen and elastin. When you sleep, your regular metabolic processes run
                                    all their functions, so getting enough rest gives them time to do this. Too little
                                    rest, on the other hand, can accelerate premature aging. Colorful fruit and
                                    vegetables contain a host of micronutrients as well as vitamins and minerals, all of
                                    which your body needs to keep its cells and skin healthy.</p>

                                <p>Most of us are aware of the importance of a healthy skincare routine on our faces,
                                    but it’s easy to forget about the neck. Your neck needs protection from harmful UV
                                    rays as much as the skin on your face and hands, and the skin on your neck will
                                    benefit from the same kinds of products as those which benefit your face; products
                                    with retinol, hyaluronic acid, and collagen.
                                </p>
                                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">None of these skincare products is a substitute for a neck
                                    lift, nor are there any
                                    topical products that can give you the kind of results a neck lift offers, but they
                                    can help to maintain your results for the full 10-15 years. Most crucially, be sure
                                    to apply sunscreen regularly. Your sunscreen should be a minimum of 30 SPF, and it’s
                                    important to re-apply sunscreen every hour or so and after going into the water.</p>

                                <p>This procedure does basically two things. First, it removes excess fat. Second, it
                                    lifts the skin of the neck into a higher and tighter position. As a result, you look
                                    slimmer, with a more defined jawline. Common reasons that people seek out this
                                    surgery include to:
                                </p>

                                    you get the look you want. A facelift or eyelift can give you a more all-around
                                    younger look, while dermal fillers or threads are less invasive ways to improve your
                                    look. Some of the options to consider include:
                                </p>
                                <ul>

                                    <li>Cheek augmentation</li>

                                </ul>
                                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">Laser skin rejuvenation, like IPL treatments, can also help
                                    to correct skin blemishes, tighten the skin, and reduce the signs of aging.

                                <p>Before your procedure, we’ll give you a list of any instructions you need to follow.
                                    These are important to follow and could include things like the following:
                                </p>

                                    <li>Avoid all alcohol and tobacco for the week prior to your procedure</li>

                                    if you have children or active pets, it’s always a good idea to get someone to give
                                    you a hand for a few days, just to make things easier.</p>

                                <ul>

                                    <li>Avoid the use of certain supplements, medications, or products for a few days,
                                        as discussed with us</li>
                                    <li>Avoid strenuous activity and exercise for a few days</li>
                                    <li>Avoid excessive heat, such as you might find in a sauna, for a few days</li>
                                    <li>Sleep elevated for about a week after treatment</li>

                                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">Other aftercare guidelines will include things like
                                    avoiding pressing on the incision sites and avoiding any clothes that have to be
                                    pulled over your head to get them on. Overall, this is not a difficult treatment to
                                    recover from. Most people are fully recovered around seven to 14 days after their
                                    treatment and are able to go back to all their normal activities.

                                <p>When you’re ready to talk to Dr. Kagan about your lift, there are a couple of things
                                    you can do to ensure that you get all the information you need and that we can help
                                    you make the best possible decisions. First, be sure to make a comprehensive list of
                                    all medications and supplements that you take. Some people prefer to just bring in
                                    the bottles, but the important thing is that you make a note of everything you take
                                    and how much you take. If you’ve ever had surgery before, let us know.
                                </p>
                                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">It’s also a good idea to get an examination by your primary
                                    care physician before you meet with us. Your primary care doctor can make sure you
                                    are in good health for surgery. Finally, be sure to write down a list of all the
                                    questions you have. It’s easy to forget something important in the middle of a
                                    consultation!
