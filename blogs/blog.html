                                            occurs. When your
                                            upper eyelids sag, you can look older and more tired than you are. Even
                                            worse,
                                            your vision may be affected to the point you can no longer drive safely or

                                <p>You may be considered a good candidate for blepharoplasty if you have cosmetic or
                                    medical concerns about your eyelids. Both cosmetic and medical concerns may arise at
                                    any age. However, they usually develop after the age of 35 due to the skin becoming
                                    inelastic. Sometimes, the upper eyelids can droop to the point vision becomes
                                    impaired. This can have a significant impact on your daily life.</p>

                                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">Other times, people seek this procedure because they want
                                    to look younger and more awake. To determine whether you are a good candidate for
                                    this procedure, you must come in for an initial evaluation. During this evaluation,
                                    we will discuss the concerns you have about your eyelids, your overall health and
                                    the results you are expecting from the procedure. With this information, we can
                                    determine whether this procedure is ideal for you.</p>

                                <p>We strongly recommend bringing your medical records to your initial consultation
                                    because your health is the most important factor affecting whether you will qualify
                                    for this procedure. It is essential that we get a clear understanding of your health
                                    so we can ensure there will be no contraindications. Specifically, if you have been
                                    diagnosed with a medical condition related to your eyes, like retinal detachment or
                                    glaucoma, you may not qualify as a candidate.</p>

                                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">Your lifestyle choices, such as whether you smoke or drink
                                    alcohol regularly, also affect your candidacy. Both cosmetic and medical procedures
                                    are safer for non-smokers. If you consume tobacco regularly, we strongly encourage
                                    you to consider quitting. Not only will you recover from the procedure faster, you
                                    will also enjoy longer-lasting results.</p>

                                <p>This procedure may be your best bet if your vision is impaired due to sagging upper

                                    able to see well if your vision is obstructed by your eyelids. You will likely be
                                    considered a good candidate for this procedure if your quality of life is affected
                                    by heavily drooping upper eyelids.</p>

                                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">Note, you should strongly consider this procedure if your
                                    upper eyelids are drooping noticeably but your vision is not yet impaired. If left
                                    uncorrected, your eyelids may droop to the point that you won’t be able to drive
                                    safely or relax and enjoy your favorite book or video game. The sooner you correct
                                    upper eyelid sagging, the more enjoyable your life will be.</p>

                                    As noted above, these problems usually arise due to inadequate elastin production.

                                    eye area and reduce puffiness. While you will look significantly younger, it will
                                    not correct natural asymmetry caused by the underlying structure of your face.</p>

                                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">Furthermore, you must be confident you can adhere to all
                                    post-op care guidelines. For example, if you can’t stand the idea of focusing on
                                    rest for several days, you will not qualify for this procedure. This procedure is

                                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">Keep in mind, the best possible outcome can be expected if
                                    you are healthy. Before your procedure, you should drink alcohol in moderation,
                                    refrain from smoking, exercise regularly and make healthy food and beverage choices.
                                    You should also make sure you have all of your post-op prescriptions prepared before
                                    you come in for your procedure. You should also prepare anything else you may need
                                    during your recovery, like healthy meals and relaxing entertainment that is easy on
                                    your eyes.</p>

                                    these incisions, excess skin and fat tissue will be removed. However, you should not

                                    within your eyelids’ folds. Depending on the scope of your procedure, this process
                                    may take between one and three hours.</p>

                                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">Note, your vision will not be impaired after your
                                    procedure. Additionally, due to the minimally invasive nature of this procedure, it
                                    is performed on an outpatient basis. In other words, you are free to go home once

                                <p>During your initial consultation, we will advise you on how to care for yourself
                                    after your procedure. We will review these instructions again once your procedure is
                                    complete to ensure you understand them. Applying antibiotic cream to the eye area is
                                    the most important thing you can do during the first week following your procedure.
                                    This cream is so important because it keeps the area from drying out.</p>

                                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">You will also be provided with a fluid that acts like
                                    teardrops. If your eyes feel dry, you can use this fluid. However, it is advisable
                                    to limit screen time so your eyes are less likely to feel dry. Furthermore, you
                                    should try to sleep upright for the first few nights following your procedure. If
                                    you can’t fall asleep upright, do your best to ensure your head remains above your
                                    heart. Additionally, you may apply a cold compress or ice gently around the eye
                                    area.</p>

                                <p>How long your recovery will take depends on the scope of your procedure. If you are
                                    receiving corrections for both your upper and lower eyelids, your recovery may take
                                    a little longer. Generally, you should expect to take five days off from work if you
                                    are receiving upper or lower eyelid correction. You should expect to take roughly 10
                                    days off from work if you are receiving upper and lower eyelid correction.</p>

                                    your recovery period is over. You will look years younger than you did before your
                                    procedure and feel more confident. To ensure these results last as long as possible,
                                    protect your eye area by wearing sunglasses and a brimmed hat, applying sunscreen

                                    appearance of your lower eyelids, you will probably never need a follow-up
                                    procedure. If you receive this procedure to improve upon your upper eyelids, you may
                                    need a maintenance procedure every five to seven years.</p>
